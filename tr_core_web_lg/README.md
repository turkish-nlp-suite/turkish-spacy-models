Turkish large sized spaCy model trained on [BOUN treebank](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-BOUN) and two NER corpora, [WikiAnn/PanX](https://github.com/google-research/xtreme) and [Turkish Newspaper NER Dataset](https://github.com/turkish-nlp-suite/NER-datasets/tree/main/Turkish-NewsPaper-NER-Dataset) . This pipeline uses large-sized Floret vectors and offers POS tagging, dependency parsing, morphological anlaysis, statistical lemmatizing and NER. The underlying vectors are is [Large-sized Turkish Floret word vectors (MC4 corpus)](https://huggingface.co/turkish-nlp-suite/tr_vectors_web_lg). Please find the model under our [Huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/turkish-nlp-suite/tr_core_news_lg).
