Medium sized [Floret](https://github.com/explosion/floret) word vectors for Turkish trained on [MC4 corpus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683).

Note that if you want to relicate the experiment, you need a good size storage. You can pick up the vectors from [Huggingface repo](https://huggingface.co/turkish-nlp-suite).
You can build the vectors run `spacy project run all`.
